Input: The maze is represented as a text file as follows.
- The first line must contain a positive integer 𝑁, representing the size of the maze.
- The second line contains 2 integers representing the entrance and exit.
- 𝑁 × 𝑁 next line contains an adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
Output: The program must print the following information to the console:
- The time to escape the maze.
- The list of nodes explored in the correct order.
- The list of nodes on the path found in the correct order.
* Search strategies implementation:
You are required to implement and provide results for the following search strategies:
- Breadth-first search (BFS) & Depth-first search (DFS)
- Uniform-cost search (UCS)
- Greedy Best First Search using the Manhattan distance as heuristic
- Graph-search A* using the same heuristic as above
